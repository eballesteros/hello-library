      "\" Biden addressed the nation, acknowledging the separation due to COVID-19 and the political divisions but emphasizing that they are first and foremost Americans united with a duty to one another and the Constitution. Last week Putin tried to disrupt the free world but Biden has confirmed his resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny.\n",
      "\n",
      " A Ukrainian president and citizens have inspired the world with their collective courage and determination against an outside threat, showing everyone that \"light will win over darkness\" in the struggle against evil.\n",
      "\n",
      " The speaker is calling for a signal to be sent to Ukraine and the world, that America stands with the Ukrainian people and for strong diplomatic action against escalating aggression. He also reminds the chamber of NATO's importance and of the need for American diplomacy.\n",
      "\n",
      " Russian President Vladimir Putin launched a premeditated, unprovoked attack on Ukraine, rejected diplomatic efforts, and expected neither the West nor NATO to intervene. In response, the U.S. led a coalition of likeminded countries in opposing Putin. They exposed Russia's false justification and disseminated their own truth.\n",
      "\n",
      " 27 European Union countries, the U.K., Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, and Korea, as well as Switzerland, have joined together to hold Russia and its leader, Putin, accountable for its lies and actions. Powerful economic sanctions are being enforced to isolate Russia from the international financial system and to inflict pain upon it, all in order to support the people of Ukraine.\n",
      "\n",
      " The US Department of Justice is taking action to prevent Russia from obtaining economic and military strength by blocking the central bank from defending the Russian Ruble and assembling a task force to target and seize assets from the corrupt Russian oligarchs. The U.S. and European allies are teaming up and going after their yachts, luxury apartments, private jets, and other ill-gotten gains.\n",
      "\n",
      " In order to further isolate and squeeze the Russian economy, the U.S. is joining their allies in closing off American air space to all Russian flights. The resulting decrease in the Ruble and Russian stock market has caused their economy to suffer greatly. With allies, the U.S. is providing Ukrainians with military, economic, and humanitarian support with $1 Billion in direct assistance.\n",
      "\n",
      " The United States is aiding the Ukrainian people without engaging conflict with Russian forces, while also mobilizing American ground forces, air squadrons, and ship deployments to protect the NATO countries of Poland, Romania, Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia, in the event of an aggressive move by Russian President Putin.\n",
      "\n",
      " The United States and its allies have vowed to use their collective power to protect all NATO territory. Despite the violence Russian President Putin has caused in Ukraine, the proud Ukrainian people have refused to allow their country to be taken over and continue to demonstrate their courage. Putin may gain ground in the short-term, but in the long run will pay a hefty price.\n",
      "\n",
      " The speaker is addressing Americans and admitting that a Russian dictator has caused problems around the world. They are taking action to limit this through sanctions, then announce a plan to release 60 million barrels of oil from reserves around the world. The United States is taking the lead, releasing 30 million barrels from their own stockpile and saying they are ready to do more if necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      " The news of the current state of affairs can be alarming, but President Obama assures the public they will be okay. Putin's war in Ukraine will leave Russia weaker, while the rest of the world becomes stronger and more united. People around the world have started to demonstrate their unified support for Ukraine.\n",
      "\n",
      " This article discusses the ongoing battle between democracy and autocracy and encourages the world to stand in solidarity with Ukraine against the forces led by Vladimir Putin. Ukrainians and Ukrainian Americans are praised for their strong will, love of freedom, and unwavering resolve.\n",

      "This speech acknowledges the hardships faced by many Americans in the last two years due to the pandemic and discusses the economic hardship faced by families, referencing the speaker's personal experience. The speaker highlights their own efforts to address the issue by fighting for the passage of the American Rescue Plan.\n",
      "\n",
      " The American Rescue Plan is a piece of legislation that has had a massive impact during the COVID-19 crisis, providing economic relief and helping to cut costs for health insurance, food, and housing. It is seen as beneficial for everyone, unlike the $2 trillion tax cut passed by the previous administration which helped the wealthiest 1%. The American Rescue Plan has been successful in creating jobs.\n",
      "\n",
      " Last year, the United States economy created a record 6.5 million jobs and posted its strongest growth in 40 years, at 5.7%. This is an encouraging sign of change in an economy that has not worked in favor of working-class people in the past four decades. Tax cuts for the wealthy were seen as a way to extend the benefits to everyone else.\n",
      "\n",
      " Vice President Harris and Joe Biden ran for office with an economic vision advocating investment in America, education for Americans, growing the workforce, and building the economy from the bottom up and the middle out. This plan is opposed to the trickle-down theory that had led to weaker economic growth and the widest gap between the rich and the poor in nearly a century. They also plan to invest in American infrastructure, which is currently ranked 13th in the world.\n",
      "\n",
      " The passage discusses the importance of passing the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, a sweeping investment to rebuild America, as a bipartisan effort to put the US on a path to win the economic competition of the 21st Century. It is noted that it will never be a good bet to bet against the American people.\n",
      "\n",
      "This plan will create jobs to modernize cities' roads, airports, ports and waterways, and address the climate crisis and environmental justice. It includes installing 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations, replacing lead pipes and providing high-speed internet to everyone, urban and rural. So far, 4,000 projects have been announced.\n",
      "\n",
      " The government is investing in infrastructure projects, buying American products to support American jobs, and spending $600 Billion annually to make sure taxpayer dollars are used to support American businesses. This law has been around for nearly a century, but the current Administration is the first to actually abide by it.\n",
      "\n",
      " This article discusses the need to invest in emerging technologies and American manufacturing and highlights an example of why it is important to pass the Bipartisan Innovation Act in Congress -- the 1,000 empty acres of land east of Columbus, Ohio. It emphasizes the importance of buying American to ensure that products are made in America.\n",
      "\n",
      " Intel is building a $20 billion mega site in the United States with up to eight state-of-the-art factories and 10,000 new jobs. It will be used to manufacture the tiny computer chips that power smartphones, the internet, and other technology. This is the start of a new American future.\n",
      "\n",
      " Intel is ready to invest $100 billion in American manufacturing, one of the biggest investments in American history. President Biden encourages Congress to pass the bill and sign it. He speaks to the \"rebirth of the pride that comes from stamping products ‚ÄúMade In America\" and the revitalization of American manufacturing.\n",
      "\n",
      " In the last few years, companies have been choosing to invest in factories in the US, leading to the creation of 369,000 manufacturing jobs in the last year alone. This investment from companies such as Ford and GM is resulting in thousands of jobs in Michigan and other areas, thanks in part to individuals like JoJo Burgess, a union steelworker from Pittsburgh. Senator Sherrod Brown's sentiments of this time marking a shift away from the label \"Rust Belt\" are echoed.\n",
      "\n",
      " Despite record job growth and higher wages, many families are struggling due to inflation. As a top priority, the speaker is focusing on getting prices in control. The economy has recovered faster than predicted, but the pandemic has caused delays in production and disrupted global supply chains, resulting in higher prices, particularly for cars.\n",
      "\n",
      " Last year, a shortage of semiconductors caused car prices to increase, prompting a choice between cutting wages to combat inflation or a better plan of lowering costs, increasing infrastructure and innovation, and making goods in America in order to increase the productive capacity of the economy.\n",
      "\n",
      " This plan aims to reduce inflation and the deficit while lowering costs. It has been supported by 17 Nobel Laureates in Economics, top business leaders, and most Americans. It will specifically lower the cost of prescription drugs, like insulin. One particular example used to illustrate this is the story of a 13 year-old boy named Joshua Davis who, along with his dad, need insulin every day and are forced to pay up to 30 times more than the cost of production.\n",
      "\n",
      " The speaker encourages greater accessibility to insulin by capping the cost at $35 per month and allowing Medicare the right to negotiate lower prescription drug prices, just like the VA already does. The speaker introduces Joshua, a young person with Type 1 Diabetes, to illustrate the importance of providing affordable insulin.\n",
      "\n",
      " The American Rescue Plan provides savings of $2,400 a year on healthcare premiums and invests in energy efficient initiatives to save an average of $500 a year in energy costs, along with tax credits and other incentives. These efforts would double clean energy production and lower the price of electric vehicles, helping people save even more.\n",
      "\n",
      " This plan will reduce the cost of child care for families, allowing parents to return to work when they couldn't previously due to expensive child care costs, as well as providing long-term care, Pre-K for 3- and 4-year-olds, and more affordable housing. This will lower costs for families and create more economic opportunity.\n",
      "\n",
      " Under this plan, nobody making less than $400,000 annually will pay new taxes. To fix the unfairness of the current tax system, corporations and wealthy Americans should start paying their fair share. To this end, a 15% minimum tax rate is proposed for corporations, who, in many cases, currently pay no federal taxes.\n",
      "\n",
      " Through negotiations with 130 countries, a global minimum tax rate has been agreed upon to prevent companies from avoiding taxation through shifting jobs or factories overseas. To continue this trend, loopholes for wealthy individuals to pay lower tax rates must be closed. This plan generate economic growth and help lower costs and deficits.\n",
      "\n",
      " The previous Administration increased the deficit with tax cuts and prevented watchdogs from monitoring the use of pandemic relief funds. The current Administration has welcomed the watchdogs back and the Justice Department will appoint a chief prosecutor to address pandemic fraud. By the end of 2021, the deficit will be significantly reduced.\n",
      "\n",
      " President Trump was the only president to ever decrease the deficit by more than one trillion dollars in a single year. He argued that capitalism is not sustainable unless there is competition, and argues that when companies lack competition, profits rise, while prices and small businesses are impacted negatively. During the pandemic, foreign-owned companies have been seen to raise prices by 1,000% and generate record profits.\n",
      "\n",
      " The speaker is announcing a crackdown on companies overcharging American businesses and consumers, as well as establishing higher standards for nursing homes and creating fair working conditions for workers. The Paycheck Fairness Act and paid leave will also be passed in order to cut costs and help the economy thrive.\n",
      "\n",
      " This essay calls for action to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour, extend the Child Tax Credit, increase Pell Grants, increase support for HBCUs, invest in community colleges and pass the PRO Act. The goal is to build a better America for our workers, by increasing upward mobility and economic security in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n",
      "\n",
      " With new CDC guidelines, most Americans in most of the country can now discard their masks and return to more normal routines. Severe COVID-19 cases have decreased to a level not seen since last July, and more of the country is slated to follow suit in the coming weeks.\n",
      "\n",
      " Although progress has been made with regards to COVID-19, it is not necessary to just accept living with it. Vaccines and treatments are necessary in order to stay protected from the virus and its mutations.\n",
      "\n",
      " Government officials are committed to getting millions of vaccines approved for adolescents, and have also ordered a significant amount of anti-viral pills to reduce the chance of ending up in the hospital with COVID-19. Pfizer is working to deliver 1 million pills this month and double that next month.\n",
      "\n",
      " This initiative, titled ‚ÄúTest to Treat‚Äù, allows people to get tested at a pharmacy and receive treatment at no cost if they test positive. Treatment and free high-quality masks are also available for those who are immunocompromised or have other vulnerabilities. Hundreds of millions of tests have been made available for free, with more available from covidtests.gov starting next week.\n",
      "\n",
      " The government promise to be prepared for new variants, deploy vaccines faster if necessary, and create new stockpiles if Congress provides funds. They also promise to end the shutdowns of schools and businesses.\n",
      "\n",
      "  As a result of the high rate of adult vaccination, hospitalizations has decreased by 77%, allowing Americans to safely return to work, school and daily life, while wearing masks as needed. The Federal Government is also returning the majority of workers to in-person offices. This success has been possible due to the availability of free vaccines, treatments, tests and masks. To maintain this progress, additional funding is needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "  President Biden is asking Congress to quickly pass a request for funding so he can continue the tools that have helped a vast majority of Americans throughout the pandemic, while also continuing to vaccinate the world. Due to the toll this virus has taken, Biden is urging people to stop looking at it as a partisan issue, and instead recognize the gravity of the situation.\n",
      "\n",
      " This article acknowledges the issue of divisions amongst fellow Americans and suggests that we can come together to face issues such as the COVID-19 pandemic. It reflects on the tragic death of two Dominican American police officers who gave their lives while responding to a 9-1-1 call. Officer Mora and Officer Rivera were 27 and 22 years old respectively.\n",
      "\n",
      " This speaker expressed gratitude for the sacrifice of those affected by crime and committed to investing in measures to restore trust and safety to communities. The speaker emphasized coming together to protect communities, restore trust, and ensure law enforcement accountability.\n",
      "\n",
      " The Justice Department has taken steps to ensure police safety and accountability, and the American Rescue Plan has provided funding to hire more police and invest in strategies to reduce violence in communities. Defunding should not be the answer; investing in the police and providing resources and training are the solutions to ensure safe neighborhoods.\"\n",

      "\" The President of the United States is calling on Congress to pass laws that would reduce gun violence, such as universal background checks and a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. These laws would not infringe on the Second Amendment but would save lives, as well as protect the most fundamental right in America - the right to vote - from being assaulted.\n",
      "\n",
      " President Biden has called on the Senate to pass three acts: Freedom to Vote, John Lewis Voting Rights, and Disclose Act in order to protect the right to vote and make election funding transparent. The President also honored Justice Stephen Breyer for his service to the United States.\n",
      "\n",
      " President Biden recently nominated Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to the United States Supreme Court.

      "\n",
      " This passage calls for immigration reform, which would provide pathways to citizenship for certain groups, revise laws so businesses can hire workers and families can reunite, and make sure immigration reform is supported. It is seen as not only the right thing to do, but also the economically smart thing to do. It further calls for protecting the rights of women.\n",

The writer also emphasizes the need to support veterans, as they embody the best of us.\n",

      "\n",
      " There is a possibility that the brain cancer and other diseases of many military troops could be due to burn pits.
